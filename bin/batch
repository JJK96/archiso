Batch, edit stdin using an editor and process the result.
Each line in the input corresponds to a line of the result,
so don't delete a whole line.
If a line is empty, drop is executed with the original value as argument.
If a line is changed, map is executed with the original and the new value as arguments.
If a line is unchanged, pick is executed with the original value as argument.
The results can be edited before executing.
This program is inspired by https://github.com/alexherbo2/batch.
